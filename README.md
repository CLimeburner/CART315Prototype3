# Prototype 3 Design Journal

For my third and final initial prototype, I decided to tackle the idea of interactive fireworks by giving players a way to act as a fireworks "conductor". This prototype connects each letter key of the keyboard to a type of firework in a specific position, and allows players to "play" along to the music as they might on a piano. This complements research-creation I conducted last semester, where players had a motion tracking wand, allowing them to control the position and timing, but not the type of firework, whereas this version allows control of type and timing, but position is much more restricted. The central question behind these inquiries is if it's possible to give an audience the tools to create their own pyrotechnics display, and empower them to exercise their own creativity. Secondary to this questions are considerations of boredom, frustration with the interface, and unfamiliarity with the accompanying music.

From a technical perspective, this prototype also seeks to explore the usage of particle systems, experimenting with systems with different shapes (sphere and cone), colours, dynamics (drag, fade), and sub-emission (splitting and trails). This exploration could easily be taken further to recreate further types of fireworks, including kinds that can't be physically made, but for the time being, variety was kept narrow so as to avoid overwhelming players.

Note: The audio track is the theme to the Mission: SPACE ride at Disney's Epcot park.

Questions for Playtesters:

1) Did you become bored at any point during the experience?

2) Did you replay the experience multiple times to gain familiarity with the music and try out new combinations of fireworks?

3) Would you want additional types of fireworks available?

4) Are there any specific types of fireworks you'd like available? (Describe in as much detail as possible, or provide a link to a video if available.)

5) Do you have any thoughts (positive or negative) on the restrictions of the user interface?

## Feedback Reflection

In reviewing the feedback for this week's playtest, several patterns emerged. The first was a classic, but ever present, split in player psychographics. More specifically, it was evident from feedback that there were clearly players who enjoyed an open-ended "expressive" experience, and others who preferred a more goal-driven task. This was even expressed in a nuanced way through the feedback of, "I think one of the most important aspects of "do what you want" games is to be able to have some kind of permanent impact on the environment, which I don't see here," which still expresses a desire for a goal, albeit sandbox-y one, rather than seeing the prototype more in parallel to transient artistic expression like playing music. This is largely an unavoidable feature of diverse player bases and can't really be helped (short of including a mode with explicit music sequence instructions), but nonetheless is worth considering while designing.

Another pattern that emerged within feedback is a tendency for players to request a more spatially immersive experience. This is to say, rather than a flat 2D view of the fireworks behind the castle in orthographic view, many expressed a desire to be standing more at ground level and capable of moving around or seeing the fireworks and castle contextualized in a broader environment. This included having various occupants in the castle as well as landscape features such as water in the immediate surrounds. This provides a clear path for a revised prototype as with relatively straightforward tweaking, the prototype could be reconcieved as a first-person experience walking around a central theme park hub plaza during a show.

On a more obvious note, various playtesters had clear ideas as to what kind of additional fireworks they would want to see as part of the show. This ranged widely from multi-break shells with crackle sound effects to flying saucers and shaped breaks. Interestingly, though seemingly no players had technical knowledge of pyrotechnics, all had reasonably developed opinions and tastes regarding the aesthetics of fireworks, which I think makes this prototype interesting for its potential to put players in the "conductors" seat, for which they wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity.

A final consideration that came up less directly in playtest feedback but was prompted by a common feature of players needing time to learn the music through repeated play to be able to "play along" to it with fireworks, was the thought of including a way for players to upload their own music. This could help lessen the learning curve for new players and create a richer experience by allowing them to build upon pieces they have pre-existing connections to.
