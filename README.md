# Prototype 3 Design Journal

For my third and final initial prototype, I decided to tackle the idea of interactive fireworks by giving players a way to act as a fireworks "conductor". This prototype connects each letter key of the keyboard to a type of firework in a specific position, and allows players to "play" along to the music as they might on a piano. This complements research-creation I conducted last semester, where players had a motion tracking wand, allowing them to control the position and timing, but not the type of firework, whereas this version allows control of type and timing, but position is much more restricted. The central question behind these inquiries is if it's possible to give an audience the tools to create their own pyrotechnics display, and empower them to exercise their own creativity. Secondary to this questions are considerations of boredom, frustration with the interface, and unfamiliarity with the accompanying music.

From a technical perspective, this prototype also seeks to explore the usage of particle systems, experimenting with systems with different shapes (sphere and cone), colours, dynamics (drag, fade), and sub-emission (splitting and trails). This exploration could easily be taken further to recreate further types of fireworks, including kinds that can't be physically made, but for the time being, variety was kept narrow so as to avoid overwhelming players.

Note: The audio track is the theme to the Mission: SPACE ride at Disney's Epcot park.

Questions for Playtesters:

1) Did you become bored at any point during the experience?

2) Did you replay the experience multiple times to gain familiarity with the music?

3) Would you want additional types of fireworks available?

4) Are there any specific types of fireworks you'd like available? (Describe in as much detail as possible, or provide a link to a video if available.)

5) Do you have any thoughts (positive or negative) on the restrictions of the user interface?
